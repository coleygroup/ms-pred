#  Mass Spectrum Predictor

This repository contains implementations for the following spectrum simulator models predicting molecular tandem mass spectra from molecules:

ICEBERG predicts spectra at the level of molecular fragments, whereas SCARF predicts spectra at the level of chemical formula. In order to fairly compare various spectra models, we implement a number of baselines and alternative models using equivalent settings across models (i.e., same covariates, hyeprparmaeter sweeps for each, etc.):

5. [Analysis](#analysis)    


## Install & setup <a name="setup"></a>

Install and set up the conda environment using [mamba](https://mamba.readthedocs.io/en/latest/):

```
mamba env create -f environment.yml
mamba activate ms-gen
pip install -r requirements.txt
python3 setup.py develop
```


## Quickstart <a name="quickstart"></a>

To make predictions, we have released and made public a version of SCARF and ICEBERG both trained upon the CANOPUS dataset (renamed NPLIB1 for clarity in corresponding manuscripts). This can be downloaded and used to predict a set of 100 sample molecules contained in the NIST library, as included at `data/spec_datasets/sample_labels.tsv` (test set):

 
```
# Scarf quickstart
. quickstart/scarf/download_model.sh
. quickstart/scarf/run_model.sh

# Iceberg quickstart
. quickstart/iceberg/download_model.sh
. quickstart/iceberg/run_model.sh
```

Model outputs will be contained in `quickstart/{model}/out/`. **We note that this model may be less performant than the model trained on the commercial NIST20 Library. Download links to models trained on NIST20 models are available upon request to any users with a NIST license.**  ICEBERG assigns intensities to various fragment masses. Refer to `notebooks/iceberg_demo.ipynb` for a walkthrough for how to process and interpret the output dictionary.


## Data <a name="data"></a>

A data subset from the GNPS database can first be downloaded and older sirius
outputs and magma runs removed.

```
. data_scripts/download_gnps.sh
```

Structural data splits can be established with `data_scripts/make_splits.py`, and the following command will create all splits in bulk:

```
. data_scripts/all_create_splits.sh
```

### SCARF Processing

Data should then be assigned to subformulae files using
`data_scripts/forms/assign_subformulae.py`, which will preprocess the data. We
produce two fragment versions of the molecule, `magma_subform_50` and
`no_subform`. The former strictly labels subformula based upon smiles structure
and the latter is permissive and allows all entries to pass. The following
script does this for both `canopus_train_public` and `nist20` if it has been
acquired and parsed (commercial dataset).

```
. data_scripts/assign_subform.sh
```


### ICEBERG Processing

In addition to building processed subformulae, to train ICEBERG, we must
annotate substructures and create a labeled dataset over the breakage process, 
which we do with the MAGMa algorithm.

This can be done with the following script, specifying an appropriate dataset:

```
. data_scripts/dag/run_magma.sh
```


### Retrieval

To conduct retrieval experiments, libraries of smiles must be created. A PubChem
library is converted and each chemical formula is mapped to (smiles, inchikey)
pairs. Subsets are selected for evaluation.  Making formula subsets takes longer
(on the order of several hours, even parallelized) as it requires converting
each molecule in pubchem to a mol / InChi. 

```
source data_scripts/pubchem/01_download_smiles.sh
python data_scripts/pubchem/02_make_formula_subsets.py
python data_scripts/pubchem/03_make_retrieval_lists.py
```

To quickly download tables for canopus:  

```
cd data/spec_datasets/canopus_train_public/
wget https://www.dropbox.com/s/7zr6euhuhz3ohi9/retrieval_tbls.tar
tar -xvf canopus_train_public.tar
```

## Experiments <a name="experiments"></a>


### SCARF

SCARF models trained in two parts: a prefix tree generator and an intensity predictor. The pipeline for training and evaluating this model can be accessed in `run_scripts/scarf_model/`. The internal pipeline used to conduct experiments can be followed below:

1. *Hyperopt scarf model*: `run_scripts/scarf_model/01_hyperopt_scarf.sh`
2. *Train scarf model*: `run_scripts/scarf_model/02_run_scarf_gen_train.sh`
3. *Sweep number of prefixes to generate*: `run_scripts/scarf_model/03_sweep_scarf_gen_thresh.py`  
4. *Use model 1 to predict model 2 training set*: `run_scripts/scarf_model/04_scarf_gen_predict.sh`   
5. *Add intensity targets to predictions*: `run_scripts/scarf_model/05_process_scarf_train.py`
6. *Hyperopt scarf inten model*: `run_scripts/scarf_model/06_hyperopt_scarf_inten.sh`

training, and predict calls can be  made using the following scripts respectively:

1. `python src/ms_pred/scarf_pred/train_gen.py`
2.  `python src/ms_pred/scarf_pred/train_inten.py`
3.  `python src/ms_pred/scarf_pred/predict_smis.py`


### ICEBERG

ICEBRG models, like SCARF, are trained in two parts: a learned fragment generator and an intensity predictor. The pipeline for training and evaluating this model can be accessed in `run_scripts/dag_model/`. The internal pipeline used to conduct experiments can be followed below:

1. *Hyperopt dag model*: `run_scripts/dag_model/01_hyperopt_dag.sh`   
2. *Train dag model*: `run_scripts/dag_model/02_run_dag_gen_train.sh`   
3. *Sweep over the number of fragments to generate*: `run_scripts/dag_model/03_sweep_gen_thresh.py`    
4. *Use model 1 to predict model 2 training set*: `run_scripts/dag_model/04_run_dag_gen_predict.sh`   
5. *Add intensity targets to predictions*: `run_scripts/dag_model/05_process_dag_train.py`

7. *Train intensity model*: `run_scripts/dag_model/07_train_dag_inten.sh`
8. *Make and evaluate intensity predictions*: `run_scripts/dag_model/08_predict_dag_inten.py`
9. *Run retrieval*: `run_scripts/dag_model/09_run_retrieval.py`  
10. *Time iceberg*: `run_scripts/dag_model/10_time_dag.py`  
11. *Export dag predictions* `run_scripts/dag_model/11_export_preds.py`


Instead of running in batched pipeline model, individual gen training, inten
training, and predict calls can be  made using the following scripts respectively:

1. `python src/ms_pred/dag_pred/train_gen.py`
2.  `python src/ms_pred/dag_pred/train_inten.py`
3.  `python src/ms_pred/dag_pred/predict_smis.py`

An additional notebook showcasing how to individually load models and make predictions can be found at `notebooks/iceberg_fig_qualitative.ipynb`.

We include a baseline variation of GRAFF-MS in which we utilize a fixed formula vocabulary.

In addition, because our data does not contain isotopic or varied adduct formula labels, we replace the marginal peak loss with a cosine similarity loss.
